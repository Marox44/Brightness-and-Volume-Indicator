## Build

Solution originally created with *Visual Studio 2013*:

- `packages/MaroxLib` is **necessary**.
- uses **NAudio** library *(included as NuGet package, should be installed automatically)*
- `Setup` is currently a Windows Installer project. Don't change it unless you know what you're doing! **After building app project, remember to rebuild** `Setup`!

##### `Build solution` might not work currently. If so, just build app project and `Setup` project separately.
